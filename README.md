# Varation: Mimic variant and PTM at site 155

## Description:

Asp 155 is the location of the mimic variant in MDH2. TPO 155 is the location of the PTM in MDH2. No previous research has been done on modifications in MDH2 at this location. 

# Comparison of MDH2 model to mimic varaint and PTM
1. Alignment of unmodified MDH2 (brown and grey), MDH2 with mimic variant (magenta and violet) , and MDH2 with PTM (green and yellow)

With the addition of the PTM, TPO 155 interacts with Ser 45, Lys 21, Thr 49, Ile 47,Glu 159, Val 151 through hydrogen bonds and PHE 156 through a hydrophobic interaction. The mimic variant has the same weak interactions as the unmodified MDH2 except for the deletion of Hydrogen bonding between His 46.

# Comparison of mimic varaint after MD simulation and unmodified MDH2
 The RMSD in the final frame from MD simulations of the mimic variant was 1.1 Ã… The unmodified MDH2 is shown in magenta while the mimic varient is shown in green.

 The overall structure of the protein is similar. The modification site in the mimic varaint is Asp 155 compared to Thr 155. The interactions are similar except for the unmodifed version having an additional hydrogen bond at His 46.

 ## Comparison of the enzyme dynamics
 RMSF
 Loop sites

 The modification signficantly affected the pKa of the active site at Histidine 176. The unmodified MDH2 shown in blue flucuates around a pKa of 4. The mimic variant flucuates around a pKa of 13.
